Pokemons Data Manipulation using pandas
##please use attached csv and update file path 
Overview
This project explores and analyzes the attributes of various Pokémon based on data from a CSV file. The dataset includes information.
such as whether a Pokémon is legendary, its type, height, weight, and capture rate. 
Using Python and pandas, various insights are derived, such as finding the heaviest Pokémon, the most common types, 
and adding a new column that classifies Pokémon based on the difficulty of catching them.
