## Description - Project Churn 
This project implements a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict customer churn from a dataset. 
The model performs binary classification, which aims to predict whether customers will leave (churn) based on their features,
such as demographics, account information, and services used.

## Northwind Dashboard
I have built a comprehensive dashboard based on the Northwind database to visualize key metrics and insights.
You can view the live dashboard on Tableau Public here:
View Dashboard on Tableau Public - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/moamen.masri/viz/shared/95J446J6N
The dashboard includes:
- Sales performance by region and product category
- Key customer and order trends
- Visual insights on inventory and employee metrics
This project analyzes the Northwind database using SQL and EXCEL for data preprocessing and Tableau for data visualization.
### Technologies Used:
-SQL and EXCEL for data cleaning and analysis
- Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation

## Tic-Tac toe game:
This project implements a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using Python. It's a simple console-based implementation that allows two players to play the game interactively. The game board is a 3x3 grid, and players alternate turns to place their mark (`X` or `O`) on the board.
 The game checks for a winner after each move or declares a tie if the board is full and no player has won.
